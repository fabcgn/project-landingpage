          <p>
            Drip-brewed, or filtered coffee is brewed by hot water passing slowly over roasted, 
            ground coffee beans contained in a filter. Water seeps through the ground coffee, 
            absorbing its oils, flavours and essences, solely under gravity, then passes through 
            the bottom of the filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter with the 
            liquid dripping into a collecting vessel such as a carafe or pot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paper coffee filters were invented in Germany by Melitta Bentz in 1908.
            To reduce waste, some coffee drinkers use fine wire mesh filters, which can be 
            re-used for years. Many countries in Latin America and Africa traditionally prepare 
            drip coffee using a small reusable bag made of cotton or other cloth.

            A French press, also known as a press pot, coffee press, coffee plunger, 
            cafetière (UK) or cafetière à piston, is a coffee brewing device patented 
            by Italian designer Attilio Calimani in 1929.[5] A French press requires a 
            coarser grind of coffee than a drip brew coffee filter, as finer grounds 
            will seep through the press filter and into the coffee
          </p>

          <p>
            Coffee in a French press is brewed by placing the ground coffee in the empty
            beaker and adding hot (93-96 degrees Celsius, 200-205 degrees Fahrenheit) water, 
            in proportions of about 28 grams (1 ounce) of coffee to 450 ml (15 fluid ounces) of water, 
            more or less to taste. After approximately four minutes the plunger is pressed to 
            separate the grounds and hold them at the bottom of the beaker, then the coffee is poured.
            Coffee press users have different preferences for how long to wait before pressing the plunger, 
            with some enthusiasts preferring to wait longer than four minutes.

          <h2>Cold brew</h2>
          <p>
            Cold brewing, also called cold water extraction or cold pressing, is the process of 
            steeping coffee grounds in water at cool temperatures for an extended period.
            Coarse-ground beans are soaked in water for about 12 to 24 hours.
          </p>

          <p>
            The water is normally kept at room temperature, but chilled water can also be used. 
            After the grounds have been steeped using a paper coffee filter, a fine metal sieve, 
            a French press, or felt, the grounds are filtered out of the water. The result is a coffee
            concentrate that is diluted with water or milk, and is served hot, over ice,
            or blended with ice and other ingredients such as chocolate.
